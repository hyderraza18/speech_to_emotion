## Introduction  
This project aims to classify emotions from speech signals using machine learning techniques. We use the **Librosa** library for audio feature extraction and various machine learning models for emotion recognition. The system processes audio signals to identify emotional states like happiness, sadness, anger, and more, based on the vocal characteristics of speech.

## Features  
- 🎧 **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features from audio signals using Librosa.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supports multiple machine learning algorithms for emotion classification.  
- 📝 **Training and Evaluation**: Provides scripts for training and evaluating models.  
- 🚀 **Pre-Trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick testing.

## Installation  
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-emotion-recognition-librosa.git
